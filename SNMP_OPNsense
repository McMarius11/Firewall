Install the Netsnmp Plugin on your OPNsense Firewall and use SNMP

Enable SNMP Service = yes
SNMP Community = community
SNMP Location = location of the device if you want
SNMP Contact = email
Add AgentX Support = yes
Layer 3 Visibility = yes
Display Version in OID = not needed
Listen IPs = type in your local Firewall IP-Adress
	

OPNnsense uses SHA-1 (SHA-96)
Privacy protocol (AES-128)
Authentication password = encryption key
Privacy pass phrase = user password

the rest should be self explanatory
